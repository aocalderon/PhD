To compile just execute the script: 

./compile.sh

Then you can run:

./bfe TIMESTAMP EPSILON MU

Where 
	TIMESTAMP	is the timestamp when points will be collected.
	EPSILON		the minimum distance two points should lay to be considered close.
	MU		the minimum number of points inside each disk.

For example:

./bfe 1 2000 100
