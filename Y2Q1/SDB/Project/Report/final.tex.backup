\section{Introduction}
In this section I plan to discuss background information and motivation about the topic.  Importance of trajectory datasets and complex motion patterns will be discussed.  I would like to introduce the notion of moving flock patterns and the challenges to find the set of disks together with some basic definitions.

The introduction gives a nice motivation and background for the proposed work. Try to make it more application-centric; that is, mention a few real-life applications that make use of the problem being addressed.  The introduction should also give the high-level idea of the solution and how it overcomes the limitations of existing work.  You might want to provide a final paragraph in the introduction that gives the overall report outline.

Spatio-temporal data is ubiquitous nowadays. Thanks to new technologies and location devices (such as Internet of Things, Remote Sensing, Smart phones, GPS, RFID, etc.), the collection of huge amount of spatio-temporal data is now possible. With the appearance of this datasets also appears the need of new techniques which allow the analysis and detection of useful patterns.  

Applications for this kind of information are diverse and interesting, in particular if they come in the way of trajectory datasets. Case of studies range from transportation system management (\cite{di_lorenzo_allaboard:_2016,johansson_efficiency_2015}) to Ecology (\cite{johnston_abundance_2015, la_sorte_convergence_2016}).  For instance, \cite{turdukulov_visual_2014} explore the finding of complex motion patterns to discover similarities between tropical cyclone paths.  Similarly, \cite{amor_persistence_2016} use eye trajectories to understand which strategies people use during a visual search. Also, \cite{holland_movements_1999} track the behavior of tiger sharks in the coasts of Hawaii in order to understand their migration patters.

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in exploiting more complex movement patterns in spatio-temporal datasets.  Traditional range and nearest neighbor queries do not capture the collective behavior of moving objects.  Moving cluster (\cite{kalnis_discovering_2005}), convoys (\cite{jeung_discovery_2008}) and flock patterns (\cite{benkert_reporting_2008, gudmundsson_computing_2006}) are new movement patterns which unveil how entities move together during a minimum time interval.  

In particular, a moving flock pattern show how objects move close enough during a given period of time.  A better understanding on how entities move in space is of special interest in areas such as sports (\cite{iwase_tracking_2002}),  surveillance and security (\cite{makris_path_2002,piciarelli_trajectory_2005}), urban development (\cite{huang_trajgraph:_2016, long_combining_2015}) and socio-economic geography (\cite{frank_life_2000}).

\section{Related Work}
Some work about spatio-temporal patterns will be revisited in order to introduce some seminal work about moving flock patterns.  BFE algorithm must be presented in this section.  Similarly, I would like to discuss some advances in spatial data analysis tools in distributed platforms (in particular Simba).

The main goal of the related work section is to position your work in the literature of related work. If all the existing work in this problem is on a single machine, you can clearly say that your work is the first work in a distributed environment. If there are other work that run in a distributed environment, you will have to mention how your problem or solution is different.

\section{Parallelizing Flock Detection}
I plan to explain the details of the algorithm implemented in Simba and how some spatial predicates introduced by it can leverage the finding of disks.

"Finding disks" seems to be very low-level for someone skimming over the report. You might want to give it a simpler title such as "Parallelizing Flock Detection" or something along these lines. It will be also a good idea to give a brief background on Simba in a separate section in case readers are not familiar with it. You only need to mention the parts that are relevant to your work.

\section{Experiments}
The setup and details about the datasets I plan to use will be discussed in this section.  It will show some figures comparing the implementation with a sequential version of the algorithm.

This part was very generic in your report outline. You need to be more specific on which datasets you will use and the types of experiments you want to run. Mainly, I'm interested to know the questions you aim to answer in the experiments section.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
I will share the lessons learned during the project and some future ideas to continue with the research.
