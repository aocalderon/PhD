	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new approach to derive groupings of mobile users based on their movement data. We assume that the user movement data are collected by logging location data emitted from mobile devices tracking users. We formally define group pattern as a group of users that are within a distance threshold from one another for at least a minimum duration. To mine group patterns, we first propose two algorithms, namely AGP and VG-growth. In our first set of experiments, it is shown when both the number of users and logging duration are large, AGP and VG-growth are inefficient for the mining group patterns of size two. We therefore propose a framework that summarizes user movement data before group pattern mining. In the second series of experiments, we show that the methods using location summarization reduce the mining overheads for group patterns of size two significantly. We conclude that the cuboid based summarization methods give better performance when the summarized database size is small compared to the original movement database. In addition, we also evaluate the impact of parameters on the mining overhead.},

	abstract = {The popularity of tracking devices continues to contribute to increasing volumes of spatio-temporal data about moving objects. Current approaches in analysing these data are unable to capture collective behaviour and correlations among moving objects. An example of these types of patterns is moving flocks. This article develops an improved algorithm for mining such patterns following a frequent pattern discovery approach, a well-known task in traditional data mining. It uses transaction-based data representation of trajectories to generate a database that facilitates the application of scalable and efficient frequent pattern mining algorithms. Results were compared with an existing method (Basic Flock Evaluation or BFE) and are demonstrated for both synthetic and real data sets with a large number of trajectories. The results illustrate a significant performance increase. Furthermore, the improved algorithm has been embedded into a visual environment that allows manipulation of input parameters and interactive recomputation of the resulting flocks. To illustrate the visual environment a data set containing 30 years of tropical cyclone tracks with 6 hourly observations is used. The example illustrates how the visual environment facilitates exploration and verification of flocks by changing the input parameters and instantly showing the spatio-temporal distribution of the resulting flocks in the Space-Time Cube and interactively selecting, querying and saving the resulting flocks for further analysis and verification.},

I was excited because the term tends to convey a new ?eld that is in the making. I was curious because I wondered what it was doing that the other ?elds of research, such as statistics and the broad ?eld of arti?cial intelligence, were not doing. After reading up on the literature, I have come to realize that it is not much different from conventional data analysis. The commonly used de?nition of knowledge discovery in databases: “the non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data” is actually in line with the core mission of conventional data analysis. The process employed by conventional data analysis is by no means trivial, and the patterns in data to be unraveled have, of course, to be valid, novel, useful and understandable. Therefore, what is the commotion all about? Careful scrutiny of the main lines of research in data mining and knowledge discovery again told me that they are not much different from that of conventional data analysis. Putting aside data warehousing and database m- agement aspects, again a main area of research in conventional database research, the rest of the tasks in data mining are largely the main concerns of conventional data analysis.},

	abstract = {This brief presents several new query processing techniques, called complex motion pattern queries, specifically designed for very large spatio-temporal databases of moving objects. The brief begins with the definition of flexible pattern queries, which are powerful because of the integration of variables and motion patterns. This is followed by a summary of the expressive power of patterns and flexibility of pattern queries. The brief then present the Spatio-Temporal Pattern System (STPS) and density-based pattern queries. STPS databases contain millions of records with information about mobile phone calls and are designed around cellular towers and places of interest. Density-based pattern queries capture the aggregate behavior of trajectories as groups. Several evaluation algorithms are presented for finding groups of trajectories that move together in space and time, i.e. within a predefined distance to each other. Finally, the brief describes a generic framework, called DivDB, for diversifying query results. Two new evaluation methods, as well as several existing ones, are described and tested in the proposed DivDB framework. The efficiency and effectiveness of all the proposed complex motion pattern queries are demonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation using real and synthetic spatio-temporal databases. This clear evaluation of new query processing techniques makes Spatio-Temporal Database a valuable resource for professionals and researchers studying databases, data mining, and pattern recognition.},

While most previous work on trajectory-based queries has concentrated on traditional range, nearest-neighbor and similarity queries, there is an increasing interest in queries that capture the "aggregate" behavior of trajectories as groups. Consider, for example, finding groups of moving objects that move "together", i.e. within a predefined distance to each other, for a certain continuous period of time. Such queries typically arise in surveillance applications, e.g. identify groups of suspicious people, convoys of vehicles, flocks of animals, etc. In this paper we first show that the on-line flock discovery problem is polynomial and then propose a framework and several strategies to discover such patterns in streaming spatio-temporal data. Experiments with real and synthetic trajectorial datasets show that the proposed algorithms are efficient and scalable.},

	abstract = {As mobile devices with positioning capabilities continue to proliferate, data management for so-called trajectory databases that capture the historical movements of populations of moving objects becomes important. This paper considers the querying of such databases for convoys, a convoy being a group of objects that have traveled together for some time. More specifically, this paper formalizes the concept of a convoy query using density-based notions, in order to capture groups of arbitrary extents and shapes. Convoy discovery is relevant for real-life applications in throughput planning of trucks and carpooling of vehicles. Although there has been extensive research on trajectories in the literature, none of this can be applied to retrieve correctly exact convoy result sets. Motivated by this, we develop three efficient algorithms for convoy discovery that adopt the well-known filter-refinement framework. In the filter step, we apply line-simplification techniques on the trajectories and establish distance bounds between the simplified trajectories. This permits efficient convoy discovery over the simplified trajectories without missing any actual convoys. In the refinement step, the candidate convoys are further processed to obtain the actual convoys. Our comprehensive empirical study offers insight into the properties of the paper's proposals and demonstrates that the proposals are effective and efficient on real-world trajectory data.},

	abstract = {A moving cluster is defined by a set of objects that move close to each other for a long time interval. Real-life examples are a group of migrating animals, a convoy of cars moving in a city, etc. We study the discovery of moving clusters in a database of object trajectories. The difference of this problem compared to clustering trajectories and mining movement patterns is that the identity of a moving cluster remains unchanged while its location and content may change over time. For example, while a group of animals are migrating, some animals may leave the group or new animals may enter it. We provide a formal definition for moving clusters and describe three algorithms for their automatic discovery: (i) a straight-forward method based on the definition, (ii) a more efficient method which avoids redundant checks and (iii) an approximate algorithm which trades accuracy for speed by borrowing ideas from the MPEG-2 video encoding. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our techniques and their applicability to large spatio-temporal datasets.},

	abstract = {Data representing moving objects is rapidly getting more available, especially in the area of wildlife GPS tracking. It is a central belief that information is hidden in large data sets in the form of interesting patterns. One of the most common spatio-temporal patterns sought after is flocks. A flock is a large enough subset of objects moving along paths close to each other for a certain pre-defined time. We give a new definition that we argue is more realistic than the previous ones, and we present fast approximation algorithms to report flocks. The algorithms are analysed both theoretically and experimentally.},
