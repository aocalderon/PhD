The modified files and some comments are described as follows:

sim-outourder.c:
	Main implementation of the DVFS controller.
power.c and power.h:
	Changes in the Powerfactor formula and computing of the total power
	consumption per interval.
main.c
	Definition and declaration of a supporting file for collecting data.
	At each run a file called 'test.txt' is created and stores the statistics
	per interval (see line 4959 at sim-outorder.c).
	
We run the following commands for each test:

For Go:

./sim-outorder -max:inst 10000000 -DVFSInterval 100000 -DVFSTargetPower 500000 ../benchmarks/go.alpha 50 9 ../benchmarks/2stone9.in 

For Anagram:

./sim-outorder -DVFSInterval 100000 -DVFSTargetPower 7400000 ../benchmarks/anagram.alpha ../benchmarks/words < ../benchmarks/anagram.in

In addition to the -DVFSInterval and -DVFSTargetPower parameters, we also
implement the -DVFSTurnOff to check if the controller should run or not.
A TRUE value for this parameter will turn off the controller.
