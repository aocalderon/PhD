\section*{Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Protocol for Internet Applications (Stoica et al., 2001)}
This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol aim to efficiently locate nodes for data storing for peer-to-peer applications.  Chord manages data and nodes using a key-value mapping and approach together with consistent hashing.  As a result, Chord is highly scalable as it adapts easily when new nodes join or leave the system.  In addition, communication cost and maintenance scale appropriately according to the number of nodes.

Section III highlights the main tenets of Chord design: load balance, decentralization, scalability, adaptability and flexible naming.  Thanks to that, Chord can be used as a library and on top of it can be implemented a diverse kind of applications.  Section IV explains the core of the Chord protocol: a consistent hashing improvement, scalable key location algorithms and dynamic operations and failures.  Finally, section V presents a detailed set of simulations to evaluate the proposed protocol.
