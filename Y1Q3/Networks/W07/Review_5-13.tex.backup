\section*{Anonymous Connections and Onion Routing (Reed et al., 1998)}
The paper describes how an implementation of anonymous connections, onion routing, can protect diverse Internet services in a private communication, particularly eavesdropping and traffic analysis. In addition, the papers provides the specification to implements new applications using onion routing.  Some characteristics of onion routing are real-time and bidirectional communication and application independence.

Onion routing networks allow data protection through onion routers, proxies and a data structure called \textit{onion}. When an anonymous connection is established through proxies, they hide who is connected to whom at each layer level.  As consequence , onion routers can only identify previous and next hops in the network and any anonymous connection appears different at each router.
