\section*{CUBIC: A New TCP-Friendly High Speed TCP Variant (Sangtae and Xu, 2005)}
This paper describes the details of CUBIC, a congestion control protocol for TCP and the current default algorithm in Linux.  At the beginning, the discussion focuses on BIC-TCP and its stability based on a binary search algorithm.  CUBIC is the next version of BIC-TCP.  Among the improvements CUBIC presents a simplification of the window adjustment algorithm (by the use of a cubic function ) and the efficient implementation of cubic root calculation.  

BIC-TCP showed problems, especially in low speed networks. The new style of window adjustment proposed by CUBIC (concave at the beginning an then convex ) improve protocol and while maintaining high network utilization.  The details of the implementation are described in Section 3.  It is nice that the authors present the pseudo-code of the algorithm together with notes which refer to subsections on the paper with a further explanation.
