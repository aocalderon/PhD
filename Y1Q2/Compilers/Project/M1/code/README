Once in an R terminal, first install knnflex package...

install.packages("knnflex.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")

then ensure you have the caret package...

install.packages("caret")

Then, you can run the scripts mentioned in the report using 'source'.  For example, to run the quick classification example, type:

source('example.R')

To run the simulation, first you have to run the 'injectError' function in the following file:

source('ErrorInjector.R')

Then, just type:

source('simulation.R')

Once you have run the simulation, you can generate the density plot with:

source('density.R')
