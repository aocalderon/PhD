Groups are defined as sets of MPOs that are directly or transitively related to each other via freely definable binary relations. Group candidates are identified within a snapshot view of the MPOs at discrete time instances. By backtracking over previous snapshots, stable group compositions over previous time instances are identified and reported. We give insight about the used data structures and algorithms for the group candidate calculation and backtracking steps and illustrate the approach's functionality with examples from a real data set.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new approach to derive groupings of mobile users based on their movement data. We assume that the user movement data are collected by logging location data emitted from mobile devices tracking users. We formally define group pattern as a group of users that are within a distance threshold from one another for at least a minimum duration. To mine group patterns, we first propose two algorithms, namely AGP and VG-growth. In our first set of experiments, it is shown when both the number of users and logging duration are large, AGP and VG-growth are inefficient for the mining group patterns of size two. We therefore propose a framework that summarizes user movement data before group pattern mining. In the second series of experiments, we show that the methods using location summarization reduce the mining overheads for group patterns of size two significantly. We conclude that the cuboid based summarization methods give better performance when the summarized database size is small compared to the original movement database. In addition, we also evaluate the impact of parameters on the mining overhead.},

  abstract = {The popularity of tracking devices continues to contribute to increasing volumes of spatio-temporal data about moving objects. Current approaches in analysing these data are unable to capture collective behaviour and correlations among moving objects. An example of these types of patterns is moving flocks. This article develops an improved algorithm for mining such patterns following a frequent pattern discovery approach, a well-known task in traditional data mining. It uses transaction-based data representation of trajectories to generate a database that facilitates the application of scalable and efficient frequent pattern mining algorithms. Results were compared with an existing method (Basic Flock Evaluation or BFE) and are demonstrated for both synthetic and real data sets with a large number of trajectories. The results illustrate a significant performance increase. Furthermore, the improved algorithm has been embedded into a visual environment that allows manipulation of input parameters and interactive recomputation of the resulting flocks. To illustrate the visual environment a data set containing 30 years of tropical cyclone tracks with 6 hourly observations is used. The example illustrates how the visual environment facilitates exploration and verification of flocks by changing the input parameters and instantly showing the spatio-temporal distribution of the resulting flocks in the Space-Time Cube and interactively selecting, querying and saving the resulting flocks for further analysis and verification.},

  abstract = {When I ?rst came across the term data mining and knowledge discovery in databases, I was excited and curious to ?nd out what it was all about. I was excited because the term tends to convey a new ?eld that is in the making. I was curious because I wondered what it was doing that the other ?elds of research, such as statistics and the broad ?eld of arti?cial intelligence, were not doing. After reading up on the literature, I have come to realize that it is not much different from conventional data analysis. The commonly used de?nition of knowledge discovery in databases: ``the non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data'' is actually in line with the core mission of conventional data analysis. The process employed by conventional data analysis is by no means trivial, and the patterns in data to be unraveled have, of course, to be valid, novel, useful and understandable. Therefore, what is the commotion all about? Careful scrutiny of the main lines of research in data mining and knowledge discovery again told me that they are not much different from that of conventional data analysis. Putting aside data warehousing and database m- agement aspects, again a main area of research in conventional database research, the rest of the tasks in data mining are largely the main concerns of conventional data analysis.},

  abstract = {This brief presents several new query processing techniques, called complex motion pattern queries, specifically designed for very large spatio-temporal databases of moving objects. The brief begins with the definition of flexible pattern queries, which are powerful because of the integration of variables and motion patterns. This is followed by a summary of the expressive power of patterns and flexibility of pattern queries. The brief then present the Spatio-Temporal Pattern System (STPS) and density-based pattern queries. STPS databases contain millions of records with information about mobile phone calls and are designed around cellular towers and places of interest. Density-based pattern queries capture the aggregate behavior of trajectories as groups. Several evaluation algorithms are presented for finding groups of trajectories that move together in space and time, i.e. within a predefined distance to each other. Finally, the brief describes a generic framework, called DivDB, for diversifying query results. Two new evaluation methods, as well as several existing ones, are described and tested in the proposed DivDB framework. The efficiency and effectiveness of all the proposed complex motion pattern queries are demonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation using real and synthetic spatio-temporal databases. This clear evaluation of new query processing techniques makes Spatio-Temporal Database a valuable resource for professionals and researchers studying databases, data mining, and pattern recognition.},

Computing with Spatial Trajectories introduces the algorithms, technologies, and systems used to process, manage and understand existing spatial trajectories for different applications. This book also presents an overview on both fundamentals and the state-of-the-art research inspired by spatial trajectory data, as well as a special focus on trajectory pattern mining, spatio-temporal data mining and location-based social networks. Each chapter provides readers with a tutorial-style introduction to one important aspect of location trajectory computing, case studies and many valuable references to other relevant research work. Computing with Spatial Trajectories is designed as a reference or secondary text book for advanced-level students and researchers mainly focused on computer science and geography. Professionals working on spatial trajectory computing will also find this book very useful.},

While most previous work on trajectory-based queries has concentrated on traditional range, nearest-neighbor and similarity queries, there is an increasing interest in queries that capture the "aggregate" behavior of trajectories as groups. Consider, for example, finding groups of moving objects that move "together", i.e. within a predefined distance to each other, for a certain continuous period of time. Such queries typically arise in surveillance applications, e.g. identify groups of suspicious people, convoys of vehicles, flocks of animals, etc. In this paper we first show that the on-line flock discovery problem is polynomial and then propose a framework and several strategies to discover such patterns in streaming spatio-temporal data. Experiments with real and synthetic trajectorial datasets show that the proposed algorithms are efficient and scalable.},

  abstract = {As mobile devices with positioning capabilities continue to proliferate, data management for so-called trajectory databases that capture the historical movements of populations of moving objects becomes important. This paper considers the querying of such databases for convoys, a convoy being a group of objects that have traveled together for some time. More specifically, this paper formalizes the concept of a convoy query using density-based notions, in order to capture groups of arbitrary extents and shapes. Convoy discovery is relevant for real-life applications in throughput planning of trucks and carpooling of vehicles. Although there has been extensive research on trajectories in the literature, none of this can be applied to retrieve correctly exact convoy result sets. Motivated by this, we develop three efficient algorithms for convoy discovery that adopt the well-known filter-refinement framework. In the filter step, we apply line-simplification techniques on the trajectories and establish distance bounds between the simplified trajectories. This permits efficient convoy discovery over the simplified trajectories without missing any actual convoys. In the refinement step, the candidate convoys are further processed to obtain the actual convoys. Our comprehensive empirical study offers insight into the properties of the paper's proposals and demonstrates that the proposals are effective and efficient on real-world trajectory data.},

  abstract = {A moving cluster is defined by a set of objects that move close to each other for a long time interval. Real-life examples are a group of migrating animals, a convoy of cars moving in a city, etc. We study the discovery of moving clusters in a database of object trajectories. The difference of this problem compared to clustering trajectories and mining movement patterns is that the identity of a moving cluster remains unchanged while its location and content may change over time. For example, while a group of animals are migrating, some animals may leave the group or new animals may enter it. We provide a formal definition for moving clusters and describe three algorithms for their automatic discovery: (i) a straight-forward method based on the definition, (ii) a more efficient method which avoids redundant checks and (iii) an approximate algorithm which trades accuracy for speed by borrowing ideas from the MPEG-2 video encoding. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our techniques and their applicability to large spatio-temporal datasets.},

  abstract = {One of the ongoing problems researchers in geography and GIS have is studying data that is inherently spatial over a long period of time. One of the main hurdles they have to overcome is the study of groups of people classified by their socio-economic status (one of the main means for governments, companies and research organisations to group together segments of the population).The amount of data collected by governments, business and research organisations has increased markedly in recent years. Geographic Information Systems have been more widely used than ever before for the storage and analysis of this information. Most GIS can handle this information spatially rather than temporally, and have difficulty with the management of socio-economic time series, which relate to spatial units. Accordingly, this book covers the issues ranging from the formal model to differentiate aspects of spatio-temporal data, through philosophical and fundamental reconsideration of time and space to the development of practical solutions to the problem. This book draws together an interdisciplinary group of scientists in the field of geography, computing, surveying and philosophy. It presents the definitive sourcebook on temporal GIS as applied to socio-economic units.},

Path models are learnt from the accumulation of trajectory data over long time periods, and can be used to augment the classification of subsequent track data. In particular, labelled paths provide an efficient means for compressing the trajectory data for logging purposes. In addition, the model can be used to compute a probabilistic prediction of the pedestrian's location many time steps ahead, and to aid the recognition of unusual behaviour identified as atypical object motion.},

  abstract = {Location Based Services (LBS) provide a new perspective for spatiotemporally analyzing dynamic urban systems. Research has investigated urban dynamics using LBS. However, less attention has been paid to the analysis of urban structure (especially commuting pattern) using smart card data (SCD), which are widely available in most large cities in China, and even in the world. This paper combines bus SCD for a one-week period with a oneday household travel survey, as well as a parcel-level land use map to identify job\textendash{}housing locations and commuting trip routes in Beijing. Two data forms are proposed, one for jobs\textendash{}housing identification and the other for commuting trip route identification. The results of the identification are aggregated in the bus stop and traffic analysis zone (TAZ) scales, respectively. Particularly, commuting trips from three typical residential communities to six main business zones are mapped and compared to analyze commuting patterns in Beijing. The identified commuting trips are validated by comparison with those from the survey in terms of commuting time and distance, and the positive validation results prove the applicability of our approach. Our experiment, as a first step toward enriching LBS data using conventional survey and urban GIS data, can obtain solid identification results based on rules extracted from existing surveys or censuses.},
